Got it! Since you want a **comprehensive README.md** for your AWS Serverless project (the last one we worked on involving a contact form API with Lambda, API Gateway, and SES), I’ll structure it professionally, with all necessary sections: project overview, architecture, setup, deployment, testing, and troubleshooting. Here’s a full draft:

````markdown
# AWS Serverless Contact Form API

A fully serverless contact form API built using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **Amazon SES** for sending emails. This project demonstrates a scalable, cost-efficient serverless architecture to handle form submissions without managing servers.

## Project Overview

This project provides an API endpoint for a contact form that:

- Accepts `name`, `email`, and `message` via HTTP POST requests.
- Sends the message to a designated email using Amazon SES.
- Returns appropriate success or error responses.

It is fully serverless and can scale automatically.

## Architecture

```text
Client (Web/App)
      |
      v
API Gateway (REST API)
      |
      v
AWS Lambda (Node.js/Python)
      |
      v
Amazon SES (Email Service)
````

**Key Points:**

* **API Gateway** handles incoming HTTP requests.
* **Lambda** processes the requests and interacts with SES.
* **SES** sends emails to recipients.
* **IAM Roles** ensure least privilege access for Lambda functions.
* **CloudWatch** logs Lambda executions for monitoring.

---

## Features

* Serverless and fully managed.
* JSON API for contact form submissions.
* Email notifications via SES.
* Input validation and error handling.
* Easily deployable via AWS Console, Serverless Framework, or Terraform.

---

## Tech Stack

* **AWS Lambda** – Serverless compute
* **API Gateway** – REST API routing
* **Amazon SES** – Email delivery
* **Node.js 18.x** – Runtime (can be Python if desired)
* **AWS IAM** – Permissions management
* **CloudWatch Logs** – Monitoring and debugging

---

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aws-serverless-contact-form.git
cd aws-serverless-contact-form
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or for Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure AWS CLI:**

```bash
aws configure
```

Ensure your IAM user has permissions for Lambda, SES, API Gateway, and CloudWatch.

4. **Verify SES domain/email:**

* Verify your sender and recipient emails in Amazon SES.
* Set SES to **production mode** if required.

---

## Deployment

### Using Serverless Framework (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g serverless
serverless deploy
```

This will:

* Deploy the Lambda function.
* Set up API Gateway endpoint.
* Configure IAM roles.

### Manual AWS Deployment

1. Zip the Lambda function and upload via AWS Console.
2. Create API Gateway REST API.
3. Connect the Lambda function as POST `/contact`.
4. Set up IAM roles with SES send permissions.

---

## Testing

1. **Using Postman / Curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>/contact \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "message": "Hello from AWS Serverless API"
}'
```

2. **Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Email sent successfully."
}
```

3. **Error Response Example:**

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid request body"
}
```

---

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables for the Lambda function:

| Variable        | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `SES_SENDER`    | Verified sender email in SES         |
| `SES_RECIPIENT` | Recipient email address              |
| `AWS_REGION`    | AWS region for SES (e.g., us-east-1) |

---

## Error Handling & Logging

* All Lambda logs are available in **CloudWatch Logs**.
* HTTP 500 indicates server-side errors; HTTP 400 for invalid requests.
* Ensure SES is verified and in the correct region.

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
4. Push branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

If you want, I can also **create a `diagram.png` for the architecture** in AWS style and suggest where it can go in the README to make it visually professional.  

Do you want me to do that next?
